## ðŸ•’ For Morning Routines & Maladaptive Daydreaming

**Do you lose track of time during your morning routine?**
**Do you struggle with maladaptive daydreaming and want to stay on task?**

Segment Timer is designed to help you:
- Stay focused and on schedule during routine tasks
- Break your morning into manageable, timed segments
- Use visual and audio cues to gently bring your attention back if you drift
- Build better habits and reduce time lost to daydreaming

### How to Use for Routines & Focus
1. **List your morning tasks** (e.g., shower, breakfast, getting dressed).
2. **Add each as a timer segment** with a realistic time limit.
3. **Start the timer sequence** and follow along.
4. **When the alert sounds or appears, move to the next task.**
5. If you catch yourself daydreaming, use the timer's cues to gently refocus.

**Tip:** Use every day for best results. Over time, you'll build awareness and structure into your mornings.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amaantootla/segment_timer.git
   cd segment_timer/app
   ```
2. **Open in VS Code:**
   - Open the folder in VS Code.
   - When prompted, "Reopen in Container" (or use the Command Palette: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`).
   - The container will build automatically using the provided `devcontainer.json`.
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
